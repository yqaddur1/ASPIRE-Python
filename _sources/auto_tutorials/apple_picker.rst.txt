Apple Picker
============

We demonstrate ASPIRE's particle picking methods using the ``Apple`` class.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 7-17

    from aspire.apple.apple import Apple

Read and Plot Micrograph
------------------------

Here we demonstrate reading in and plotting a raw micrograph.

    with mrcfile.open(filename, mode="r") as mrc:
        micro_img = mrc.data

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 33-38

Initialize Apple
----------------

Initiate ASPIRE's ``Apple`` class.
``Apple`` admits many options relating to particle sizing and mrc processing.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 38-44

.. code-block:: default


    apple_picker = Apple(
        particle_size=78, min_particle_size=19, max_particle_size=156, tau1=710, tau2=7100
    )









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 45-50

Pick Particles and Find Centers
-------------------------------

Here we use the ``process_micrograph`` method from the ``Apple`` class to find particles in the micrograph.
It will also return an image suitable for display, and optionally save a jpg.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 50-55

.. code-block:: default


    centers, particles_img = apple_picker.process_micrograph(filename, create_jpg=True)

    # Note that if you only desire ``centers`` you may call ``process_micrograph_centers(filename,...)``.
